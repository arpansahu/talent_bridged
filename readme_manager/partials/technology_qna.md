## What is Python ?
Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the
use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming 
paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and functional programming.

## What is Django ?
Django is a Python-based free and open-source web framework that follows the model-template-view architectural pattern.

## What is Redis ?
    
Redis is an in-memory data structure project implementing a distributed, in-memory key-value database with optional durability. 
The most common Redis use cases are session cache, full-page cache, queues, leader boards and counting, publish-subscribe, and much more. in this case, we will use Redis as a message broker.

## What is Ajax?
Ajax is a set of web development techniques that uses various web technologies on the client-side to create asynchronous web applications. With Ajax, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page.

## What is Web Sockets ?

WebSocket is bidirectional, a full-duplex protocol that is used in the same scenario of client-server communication, unlike HTTP it starts from ws:// or wss://. It is a stateful protocol, which means the connection between client and server will keep alive until it is terminated by either party (client or server). After closing the connection by either of the client and server, the connection is terminated from both ends. 

## What is Channels?
Channels preserve the synchronous behavior of Django and add a layer of asynchronous protocols allowing users to write the views that are entirely synchronous, asynchronous, or a mixture of both. Channels basically allow the application to support “long-running connections”. It replaces Django’s default WSGI with its ASGI.
