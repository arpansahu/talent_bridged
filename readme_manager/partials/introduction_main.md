## Learning and Technologies Used

To build **Talent Bridged**, we learned and utilized several technologies to optimize performance and ensure the system can handle large volumes of requests without compromising stability.

### Transition to Asynchronous Operations
Initially, our project used synchronous APIs, which caused the server to hang under heavy loads. To address this issue, we transitioned our project to use asynchronous APIs, enabling non-blocking operations and significantly improving the handling of multiple simultaneous requests.

### Optimized Database Interaction
We reduced the load on our PostgreSQL database by minimizing the number of interactions during API calls. For example, counter management tasks were moved to **Redis** to avoid frequent database access. **Redis** also plays a key role in ensuring concurrency control, with Redis locks used to manage resource access effectively.

### Kafka for High Throughput Logging
We integrated **Kafka** for logging API requests due to its ability to handle high throughput with low latency. This helps us maintain efficient, scalable logging without putting a strain on the main application infrastructure.

### Efficient Batch Processing with Celery
We use **Celery** jobs to periodically dump counter data and kafka logs into the database. Instead of inserting log records individually, the logs are batch-inserted, which reduces the database load and enhances performance.

### VPN to Proxy Conversion
We have developed a technology using **OpenVPN** that converts VPNs into proxies, providing a unique and scalable rotating proxy mechanism. This ensures users always receive different IP addresses when scraping, thereby enhancing anonymity and efficiency. In the future, we plan to partner with more proxy providers to offer the best possible solution.

### Monitoring and Alerts for Scrapy Servers
With the **Monitoring & Alerts** feature, users will soon be able to monitor their **Scrapy** servers, schedule tasks, and set up alerts for job status and performance metrics. This feature is part of our upcoming updates, designed to provide better control and visibility for users.

### RabbitMQ for Email Transactions
Currently, we have integrated **RabbitMQ** to handle email transactions, which ensures reliable delivery. While transactional emails are yet to be fully integrated, basic account-related notifications are already functional.

## Future of AI with Scraping
The introduction of **AI** in web scraping aims to simplify the process of writing spiders for different websites. **Scrapy**, which we currently use for scraping career pages of various companies, often requires manually writing spiders for each unique website, which is time-consuming. Our goal is to leverage AI to automate this processâ€”enabling the AI to analyze HTML tags and structures, understand page layouts, and generate spiders autonomously. This will save significant time and effort while increasing scalability.

## Payment Gateway Integration
To accommodate customers globally, we have integrated **PayPal** for international transactions and **Razorpay** for Indian customers. The choice of payment gateway is determined dynamically based on the customer's location and billing address, ensuring a seamless checkout experience.

**Talent Bridged** is designed to make web scraping efficient, scalable, and user-friendly, offering a powerful tool for extracting valuable insights from the web while optimizing every aspect of the process for performance and reliability. Proudly built completely by Arpan Sahu.
