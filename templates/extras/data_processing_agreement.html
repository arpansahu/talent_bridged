            <p>Definitions:</p>
            <ul>

            <h2 id="rights-data-subjects">Rights of Data Subjects</h2>
            <p>The Data Controller is responsible for obtaining all necessary consent from Data Subjects for ScrapeOptimus to process personal data.

            <h2 id="sub-processors">Sub-Processors</h2>
            <p>The Data Controller agrees that ScrapeOptimus may engage third-party Sub-processors to provide the Services. These Sub-processors will only access personal data for the purposes of providing the services ScrapeOptimus retained them for.</p>

            <h2 id="security">Security</h2>
            <p>ScrapeOptimus agrees to implement and maintain appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards of personal data stored using the Services.</p>

            <p>If ScrapeOptimus becomes aware of unlawful access to the Data Controller's personal data, it will promptly notify the Data Controller, investigate the breach, and provide information about it. ScrapeOptimus will follow its policies and procedures to mitigate the effects and minimize any damage from the breach.</p>

            <h2 id="deletion-customer-data">Deletion of Customer Data</h2>
            <p>ScrapeOptimus agrees to delete customer personal data in accordance with its procedures and Data Protection Laws. At a Customer's request, ScrapeOptimus will provide a certification of deletion.</p>

            <h2 id="legal-effect">Legal Effect</h2>
